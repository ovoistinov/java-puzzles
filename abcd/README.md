## Environment set up

Software:

- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Sublime user preferences:

- Auto-completion disabled
- Basic code formatting adjusted (see config file below)
- Java compiler and runtime plugin added
- Monokai color scheme

I prefer a three column layout to have the code, input and output on the screen simultaneously.

## Basic coding guidelines
