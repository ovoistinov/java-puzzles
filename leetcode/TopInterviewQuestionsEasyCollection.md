## Array

Array type of questions were asked in interviews frequently. You will most likely encounter one during your interviews.

- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
- Rotate Array
- Contains Duplicate
- Single Number
- Intersection of Two Arrays II
- Plus One
- Move Zeroes
- Two Sum
- Valid Sudoku

## Strings

String type of questions were asked in interviews frequently. You will most likely encounter one during your interviews.

- Reverse String
- Reverse Integer
- First Unique Character in a String
- Valid Anagram
- Valid Palindrome
- String to Integer (atoi)
- Implement strStr()
- Count and Say
- Longest Common Prefix

## Linked List

Linked List problems are relatively easy to master. Do not forget the Two-pointer technique, which not only applicable to Array problems but also Linked List problems as well.

Another technique to greatly simplify coding in linked list problems is the dummy node trick.

We recommend: Reverse Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists and Linked List Cycle.

For additional challenge, solve these problems recursively: Reverse Linked List, Palindrome Linked List and Merge Two Sorted Lists.

- Delete Node in a Linked List
- Remove Nth Node From End of List
- Reverse Linked List
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Palindrome Linked List
- Linked List Cycle

## Trees

Tree is slightly more complex than linked list, because the latter is a linear data structure while the former is not. Tree problems can be solved either breadth-first or depth-first. We have one problem here which is great for practicing breadth-first traversal.

- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- Validate Binary Search Tree
- Symmetric Tree
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## Sorting and Searching

These problems deal with sorting or searching in a sorted structure.

- Merge Sorted Array
- First Bad Version

## Dynamic Programming

Here are some classic Dynamic Programming interview questions.

- Climbing Stairs
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Maximum Subarray
- House Robber

## Design

These problems may require you to implement a given interface of a class, and may involve using one or more data structures. These are great exercises to improve your data structure skills.

- Shuffle an Array
- Min Stack

## Math

Most of the math questions asked in interviews do not require math knowledge beyond middle school level.

- Fizz Buzz
- Count Primes
- Power of Three
- Roman to Integer

## Others

Here are some other questions that do not fit in other categories.
